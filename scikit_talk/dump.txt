"""
Preprocessor module - build dataframes from files (e.g. .eaf, .cha, .txt).
The Preprocessor module takes transcription files as an input, and returns them in a dataframe or .csv file with a unified formatting.
This module currently contains 3 functions. They essentially execute similar tasks for different transcription formats.
They read in differently formatted conversational speech data, returning them in a universal format, which is then comparable, concatenatable,
and easier to work on.
The functions of the Preprocessor module take two arguments, an input path, and an output path, where the latter is optional.
If an output path is given, the functions write a .csv file into it, which contain a dataframe of all the transcription files that were read in.
If only an input file is given, the functions return a dataframe of the data.
The data is organized into the following: begin, end, speaker, utterance, source.
If the corpus provides timestamps, 'begin' and 'end' will contain these in a pandas.datetime format.

    """This function reads .cha files, transcriptions of speech that were produced in the CHAT format.
    The function takes the files, reads and appends them one by one, line by line, and returns one dataframe.
    The function takes two arguments: an input path (e.g. path_in) and an output path (e.g. path_out), where the latter is optional.
    If you only give the input path (path_in), the function returns a pandas dataframe object.
    If you give the optional output path (*path_out) as well, the function writes the dataframe into that, as a .csv file.
    path_in should be a string, pointing to a folder where .cha files are located. Example: path_in = '/folder/'
    *path_out should be a string, pointing to a folder where you want your dataset written. Example: path_out = '/folder/output/'
    You have to make this output directory yourself before calling the function.
    Overall, calling the function should look like the following:
    preprocessor.cha_to_dataframe(path_in)
    OR preprocessor.cha_to_dataframe(path_in, path_out)
        :param int num1: The first number
        :param int num2: The second number
        :returns: The sum of two numbers
        :rtype: int
